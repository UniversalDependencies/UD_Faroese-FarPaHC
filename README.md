# Summary

UD_Icelandic-FarPaHC is a conversion of the [Faroese Parsed Historical Corpus (FarPaHC)](https://github.com/einarfs/farpahc) to the Universal Dependencies scheme.

The conversion was done using [UDConverter](https://github.com/thorunna/UDConverter).

# Introduction

The Faroese Parsed Historical Corpus (FarPaHC) is a 53,000 word corpus which includes three texts from the 19th and 20th centuries. These texts were originally manually parsed according to the Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English (PPCHE) annotation scheme. Two of these parsed texts where then automatically converted to the Universal Dependencies scheme to create UD_Faroese-FarPaHC.

### Sentences

Each sentence ID in UD_Faroese-FarPaHC  carries the following information:

Example ID: `1928.NTACTS.REL-BIB,1.1`

- Publication year of the text (`1928`)
- Name of the text (`NTACTS`)
- Text genre (`REL-BIB`)
- Index within text (`1`)
- Index within file (`1`)

As all the texts in the corpus are excerpts from the Bible, the only text genre present in the sentence IDs is `REL-BIB`, i.e., _religious text, biblical_.

### Additional notes: Morphological Features

The UD morphological features in the corpus were converted from the FarPaHC PoS tags, which do not encode all possible grammatical categories for the language as described by the [UD language documentation for Faroese](https://universaldependencies.org/is/index.html). The features that do appear in UD_Faroese-FarPaHC are shown below, organised by grammatical category.

- Nouns: `Case`, `Definite`, `Number`
- Verbs: `Tense`, `Mood`, `Verbform`, `Case`
- Pronouns: `Case`, `Gender`, `Number`
- Numerals: `Case`
- Adjectives: `Case`, `Degree`
- Adverbs: `Case`, `Degree`, (`Definite`, `Number`)
- Determiners: `Case`
